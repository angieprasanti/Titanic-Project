                    The Titanic started her trip from Southampton for New York on Wednesday. Late on Sunday night she
                    struck an iceberg off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. By wireless telegraphy she sent out signals
                    of distress, and several liners were near enough to catch and respond to the call.<br>

                    Conflicting news, alarming and reassuring, was current yesterday. Even after midnight it was said
                    all the passengers were safe. All reports, of course, depended on wireless telegrams over great
                    distances.

                    Late last night the White Star officials in New York announced that a message had been received
                    stating that the Titanic sank at 2.20 yesterday morning after all her passengers and crew had been
                    transferred to another vessel. <br> <br>
                    Later they admitted that many lives had been lost. An unofficial message from Cape Race,
                    Newfoundland, stated that only 675 have been saved out of 2,200 to 2,400 persons on board. This was
                    in some degree confirmed later by White Star officials in Liverpool, who said they were afraid the
                    report was likely to prove true. Assuming that only 675 of the passengers and crew have been saved,
                    and taking the smallest estimate of the number of people on board, the disaster is one of the most
                    awful in the history of navigation, for at least 1,500 lives have been lost.
